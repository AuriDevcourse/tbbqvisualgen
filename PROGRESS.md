# TechBBQ Visual Generator — Progress

Single living doc for picking the project back up. **Architecture** and
**Open work** sections matter most. Historical log at the bottom is for
context.

---

## What it is

Internal tool for the TechBBQ team to compose on-brand social-media visuals on
a multi-format canvas (square 1500×1500, presentation 1920×1080, Instagram
story 1080×1920, or custom). Users compose with text layers, vector shapes
(rectangle / circle / line / star), uploaded images (up to 10), and the
TechBBQ logo, on top of an animated liquid-metal background. Photoshop-style
multi-select, marquee, group drag, undo/redo, lock, group/ungroup, align,
distribute, z-order. Export to PNG or JPG at exact canvas resolution.

Live at `http://localhost:3000` during `npm run dev`. Production target is
Vercel; production branch is `master`.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (Turbopack, React 19, `reactCompiler: true`), Tailwind v4.
- **Radix UI** (popovers).
- **`@paper-design/shaders-react`** — animated WebGL liquid-metal backgrounds.
- **`html-to-image`** — PNG/JPG export + template thumbnail capture.
- **Sonner** — toasts.
- **Resend** — `/api/feedback` route only.
- Fonts: **Onest** and **Inter** (via `next/font/google`).

## How to run

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local        # fill in keys
npm install
npm run dev                        # localhost:3000
```

`RESEND_API_KEY` + `FEEDBACK_EMAIL` are used by the in-app Feedback button.

## Architecture

### Document state model (`src/types/template.ts`)

The whole design is one `DesignConfig` object kept inside a `DocSnapshot`
that bundles `{ format, customSize, design, canvasImages }`. The bundle is
managed by **`useUndoableDoc`** (history hook) and persisted to
`sessionStorage` under `tbbqvisualgen.session.v4` (**bump key on schema
changes**).

Element types stored inside the doc:

- **`TextElement`** — `id, content, fontSize, position {x,y}, color, gradient, weight, italic, uppercase, letterSpacing, lineHeight, rotation, opacity, blur, align, hidden, locked, font ("onest" | "inter"), groupId`.
- **`CanvasImage`** — `id, src, x, y, width, height, cornerRadius, border, borderColor, borderWidth, crop {x,y,w,h}, naturalWidth, naturalHeight, hidden, locked, groupId`. Lives in `design.canvasImages` array (separate from `design` for batched-update reasons).
- **`ShapeElement`** — `id, type ("rectangle" | "circle" | "line" | "star"), x, y, width, height, fillType ("fill" | "outline"), strokeWidth, colorType ("solid" | "gradient"), color1, color2, opacity, blur, rotation, borderRadius (rect, number or per-corner), spikes/innerRadius (star), hidden, locked, groupId`.
- **`design.layerOrder`** — array of stable layer-ids (bottom→top), reconciled against the actual elements via `reconcileLayerOrder()` so missing/new entries land predictably.
- Background, color overlay, TechBBQ logo are part of `design` (not arrays).

### Selection model

Single source of truth: **`selectedIds: Set<string>`** in `page.tsx`. Layer ids
use the convention `text:<id>` / `image:<id>` / `shape:<id>`. Marquee selection
+ click-select both pipe through `selectWithGroup`, which auto-expands to all
group members if the clicked element has a `groupId`. The compat shim
`selectedImageId` (derived; non-null only when exactly one image is selected)
keeps the old single-image components working.

### Undo / redo (`src/hooks/useUndoableDoc.ts`)

History stored INSIDE the state object (`past`, `present`, `future`,
`txDepth`, `txPushed`) so every reducer call is pure and React 19's compiler
+ StrictMode can't desync it. Cap = 10 entries. Continuous edits (drags,
slider ticks, color-picker drags, arrow-key nudges) are wrapped in
transactions via `beginTransaction()` / `endTransaction()` so the whole
streak collapses into one undo step.

Transactions are opened/closed by:
- Drag handlers in `ImageDragOverlay`, `ShapeDragOverlay`, `DynamicTemplate`'s text + logo handlers.
- A global pointer listener on `<input type="range">` and `<input type="color">` so slider/color-picker drags transaction without per-component wiring.
- Arrow-key nudge debounces over 400ms.

### Canvas DOM hierarchy

```
previewContainer (auto-scales)
  └── canvasWrapRef (= page-level fixed-size frame, dims.width × dims.height)
       ├── exportRef (the thing html-to-image captures)
       │    └── <DynamicTemplate />
       │         ├── liquid-metal shader background
       │         ├── color overlay
       │         ├── canvas images (one <div><img/></div> each)
       │         ├── shape elements (div or <svg>)
       │         ├── text elements (contentEditable divs)
       │         └── TechBBQ logo
       ├── grid overlay (100×100 SVG, behind elements visually but pointer-events:none)
       ├── marquee rectangle (visible during drag)
       ├── snap-guide lines (orange, live during drag)
       ├── overflow bars (red on edges, on text overflow)
       ├── lock badges (orange 🔒 on every locked element)
       ├── crop-edit UI (when an image is in inline crop mode)
       ├── ImageDragOverlay (one per image — bbox + 4 resize handles)
       └── ShapeDragOverlay (one per visible shape — bbox + handles; SVG hit-test for outline shapes)
```

Important: **everything outside `exportRef` never appears in PNG/JPG output**.
That's how marquee, snap guides, lock badges, grid, overflow bars stay out of
the final image.

### Canvas elements: data attributes

Every interactive canvas element carries:
- `data-canvas-element="<layer-id>"` — used by marquee selection (DOM-query
  for bbox intersection) and by the right-click handler to identify which
  element was clicked.
- `data-locked="true"` (when locked) — used by some hover hints.
- ImageDragOverlay containers carry `data-canvas-overlay="image"` so the
  marquee handler skips clicks on corner handles.

### Group drag

`beginGroupDrag(draggedId)` snapshots **pre-drag center positions** for every
selected element (skipping locked ones) into `dragOriginsRef`. Each move tick
calls `groupDragMoveBy(dx, dy)` which adds the delta to every snapshotted
origin in one `setDoc` call (= one undoable entry). Auto-selects the dragged
element if it wasn't in the selection.

### Inline crop (Google Slides–style)

Stored crop is in source-fractions of the natural image (`x, y, width,
height`). On crop entry, `cropSnapshot` state captures the render geometry so
the image stays at a fixed scale while the user pans / resizes the crop
window. 4 corner handles + a pan area inside the orange outline. Aspect is
locked to `frameAspect / sourceAspect` so the in-canvas frame size doesn't
distort. Click outside canvas / Esc / drag another element exits.

### Snap / align

Shared `src/lib/snap.ts` is used by text drag, image drag, shape drag, and
logo drag. Targets = canvas edges + thirds + every OTHER selected element's
edges/centers. Threshold ≈ 0.8% (≈12px on 1500). Orange guide lines render
during drag, outside `exportRef`.

### Backgrounds

18 liquid-metal presets in `src/components/CanvasBackground.tsx` — one shader
family with different colors / shapes / motion. Picker thumbnails are
**static CSS gradients** (no WebGL) so 18 thumbnails + 1 main canvas don't
exceed the browser's ~16-context limit.

### Templates (`src/hooks/useTemplates.ts`)

Saved to `localStorage` under `tbbqvisualgen.templates.v1`. Each template has
a small PNG thumbnail (captured via `html-to-image` at pixelRatio 0.18). Save
/ load (undoable — uses `setDoc` not `replaceAll`) / rename (inline edit) /
delete (two-click confirm). ~50–80 templates fit in the 5MB localStorage cap
for typical text-heavy designs.

### Left tool tabs (was a wizard — de-wizared 2026-07-02, branch `ux-p1-dewizard`)

The left column is now a **persistent tab bar** (`Stepper.tsx`, `role="tablist"`/`role="tab"`/`aria-selected`), not a linear wizard. The old `StepNavigator` (Back / "Step X of Y" / Next + its export button) was **removed** — every tool is one click away, random-access. Tabs still switch the active panel via `goToStep`/`currentStep`, and auto-switch on canvas selection still works.

The 4 tabs + auto-switch on canvas selection:
1. **Canvas** — format, background picker (18 presets), color overlay.
2. **Text** — add/manage text layers (font picker Onest/Inter, font-size dropdown + free input, color picker, weight, alignment, italic/uppercase/gradient toggles, line height, rotation, opacity, blur sliders).
3. **Images** — TechBBQ logo on/off + style; batch image upload (up to 10), per-image controls (size sliders, corner radius, border color + stroke width input, crop).
4. **Elements** (was "Shapes" — renamed 2026-07-02; holds photo slots + shapes) — Add-photo-slot + 4 shape add buttons + per-shape editor (fill/outline, solid/gradient color, stroke, opacity, blur, rotation; rect-only linked/unlinked per-corner radius; star-only spikes + inner radius).

Clicking a canvas element auto-switches the wizard to its matching step and
expands the row in the editor. Manual step nav is sticky after that.

### Export (header, persistent — moved here 2026-07-02)

Primary **Save image** button + PNG/JPG radiogroup toggle live top-right in the
header, always visible (wired to `handleExport()` / `setExportFormat`; disabled
when `canvasIsEmpty` or `isExporting`). Export is no longer gated behind a
wizard step. The old duplicate JPG-only quick-save Download button was removed
from the canvas controls strip. `⌘E` still exports with the selected format.

### Layers panel (docked, persistent — was floating; 2026-07-02)

`showLayers` now defaults **true**. The panel is a persistent `<aside>` third
column in the main content flex row (was an absolute floating element over the
canvas). The strip Layers toggle collapses/expands it; the old
click-outside-to-close effect was removed. A **`ResizeObserver` on
`previewContainerRef`** rescales the canvas when the dock toggles (window-resize
alone didn't catch the width change).

### Canvas controls strip (above the preview)

Left → right: Undo · Redo · Grid toggle · Align popover ·
Layers toggle · Pause/Resume animation. The grid is a 100×100 SVG overlay
(pure visual aid, never exports). Align popover handles align-to-canvas
(single-select) or align-to-selection-bbox (multi-select) + distribute
horizontally/vertically (≥3 selected).

### Templates modal

Header → "Templates" button (badge shows count) → modal with name + Save +
template grid (thumbnail · click loads · inline rename on name click · trash
with confirm-tick).

### Right-click context menu (unified)

Sections separated by hairlines, all with keyboard hints:
1. Duplicate (⌘D)
2. Bring forward (⌘]) · Bring to front (⇧⌘]) · Send backward (⌘[) · Send to back (⇧⌘[)
3. Group (⌘G — when 2+ selected) · Ungroup (⇧⌘G — when any selected is in a group)
4. Lock/Unlock · Delete

The handler reads `target.closest('[data-canvas-element]')` synchronously so
right-clicking an unselected element selects the right thing without waiting
for React state to commit.

### Keyboard shortcuts

- **⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z** — undo / redo.
- **⌘C / ⌘V / ⌘D** — copy / paste / duplicate (in-memory clipboard, separate from OS clipboard).
- **⌘G / ⇧⌘G** — group / ungroup.
- **⌘] / ⌘[** — bring forward / send backward.
- **⇧⌘] / ⇧⌘[** — bring to front / send to back.
- **Backspace / Delete** — delete (skips locked).
- **Esc** — clear selection (or exit crop mode if active).
- **Arrow keys** — nudge 1px; **Shift+Arrow** — nudge 10px.
- **⌘E** — export with the currently-selected format (PNG/JPG).
- **Shift while resizing** — lock aspect ratio.
- **Alt while resizing** — scale from center.

Keyboard shortcuts are skipped when the user is typing in an `<input>` /
`<textarea>` / `contentEditable` so character-level Cmd+Z, Cmd+C, etc. still
work in fields.

### Locking

Toggle via the **Lock 🔒 icon in each Layers panel row** OR right-click → Lock.
Locked elements:
- Have `data-locked="true"` on their canvas DOM.
- Show an orange 🔒 badge in the top-left corner on canvas (outside `exportRef`).
- Are **still selectable** (mousedown selects, marquee includes them, Layers panel click selects).
- **Can't be dragged** — drag handlers bail after selecting.
- **Can't be deleted** by Backspace.
- **Group-drag skips them** (origins map excludes locked).
- **Outline-only rect/circle shapes** use SVG hit-test so the hollow interior is click-through (only the stroke catches clicks).

### Export pipeline (`src/hooks/useExport.ts`)

Captures `exportRef` via `html-to-image` (toPng / toJpeg). JPEG flattens
alpha onto `#15110e`. Background animation auto-pauses for the capture and
resumes after. Two passes — first warms up font loading, second captures.

## Conventions

- **Verify-after-ship rule**: after any user-facing change, launch a verification agent to trace the wiring end-to-end before reporting done. Strict — only skip for pure config / typo edits.
- **STORAGE_KEY bumping**: bump `tbbqvisualgen.session.v4` if the doc schema changes incompatibly. Hydrate code merges `{ ...DEFAULT_DESIGN, ...saved.design }` so additive optional fields work without a bump.
- **Coords are fractional (0–1, center-anchored)** unless explicitly suffixed `Px`. Width/height too. Convert at the canvas-render boundary.
- **Outside exportRef pattern**: anything that's purely a UI aid (marquee, snap guides, lock badges, grid, drag overlays) is rendered as a SIBLING of `exportRef`, never inside it. Otherwise the PNG export would capture it.
- **Pointer-down patterns**: drags use a click-vs-drag threshold (4px). Pointer-down captures the start ref; pointer-move sets `dragging=true` only after the threshold so a click without movement doesn't accidentally commit a position change.

---

## Dormant code

- `/api/generate` — OpenRouter / Claude endpoint for an AI chat. Not wired into the UI right now. Live endpoint, dormant features.
- MP4 export in `useExport.ts` (`exportMp4`) — works, no UI button. Adobe-style "export as video" if anyone wants it.
- `CropDialog.tsx` — original modal crop. Still wired in ImagePlacer ("Crop image" button). The inline crop in DynamicTemplate is the Google Slides–style one we built later; both coexist.

---

## Open work / suggested next steps

In rough priority order. **Top priority is first-run intuitiveness** (Auri, 2026-07-02): everything below the P0 block is secondary to making the cold entry make sense.

**P0 · First-run flow (from a live cold-run walkthrough, 2026-07-02; work on branch `ux-p1-dewizard-notes`, PR #1).** Ran the app and walked the empty-session entry + all 4 tabs. Status per finding:

1. **Templates showed in three places at once.** DONE — removed the duplicate preset list from the Canvas tab (now Format + Background + Logo + Overlay only); the empty-canvas gallery is the single start door.
2. **Gallery overlay was see-through over the animated bg.** DONE — added an opaque scrim (`bg-black/65 backdrop-blur`).
3. **Empty-canvas placeholder text was illegible.** DONE — placed the copy in a dark blurred pill so it reads over the bright bg.
4. **Scary variant-badge / "no variant yet" metadata.** Mostly resolved as a side effect of #1 (the noisy list is gone from the Canvas tab). Re-check if it resurfaces in the gallery.
5. **Placeholder preset names ("Preset 3", "Panel 4").** MOOT — all built-in presets cleared (clean slate, `PRESETS = []`); the team authors + ships its own.
6. **Format was buried.** DONE — Format now leads the Canvas tab (after removing the template list).
7. **Layers panel docks open on an empty canvas.** STILL OPEN — default it closed until ≥1 user layer.
8. **Overlapping start/reset vocabulary** (`New` / `Start blank` / `Browse templates` / `Start over`). STILL OPEN — consolidate.
   - Walkthrough + verification screenshots live in the job tmp dir (`shots*/`), not committed.

**P2 · Naming + onboarding.** DONE (2026-07-02): "Shapes" tab → **"Elements"**; removed all decorative `▪` section bullets across step files + TemplatesModal + CropDialog. STILL OPEN: folded into P0 above (preset naming, variant-badge noise, template/preset vocabulary).

**P3 · Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA).** DONE (2026-07-02): semantic landmarks (header/main/aside); contrast bump on 120 low-opacity text classes (14 files); focus-visible rings on all 13 inputs. STILL OPEN (below P0 now): empty-canvas overlay contrast (see P0 #3); keyboard layer reorder + keyboard path to canvas selection; `TemplatesModal` `role="dialog"` + Esc + focus trap (move all 3 modals to Radix Dialog); promote glyph-free section labels to real `<h2>/<h3>` headings.

**Feature backlog (all below the P0 first-run work):**

1. **Image effects parity** — rotation, opacity, blur sliders on uploaded images (texts have them; images don't).
2. **Custom background image** — upload your own image as canvas background (with scale + X/Y position), separate from regular image layers.
3. **Solid + gradient backgrounds** — two-color gradient with angle alongside the liquid-metal presets.
4. **Smart guides** — pink lines popping in during drag when an edge/center matches another element's edge/center. The snap math is there; just needs visual feedback during drag.
5. **Zoom + pan + fit** — ⌘+ / ⌘- / ⌘0 and space-bar pan. Currently the preview is fixed-fit.
6. **Blend modes + opacity in Layers panel** — per-row blend mode dropdown + opacity slider, photoshop-style.
7. **Eyedropper** — pick a color from anywhere on canvas, or from a previously-saved color.
8. **Keyboard shortcut cheatsheet** — `?` opens an overlay listing every shortcut.
9. **Star outline hit-test** — currently star outline catches clicks anywhere in bbox (rect/circle outline already SVG hit-test).
10. **Group resize** — when a group is selected, optionally show a single bbox + handles that scale all members proportionally.
11. **Export presets** — render the same design as Square + Story + Presentation in one click.

## Verified-shipped features (chronological hits)

Newer at the top.

**Session 2026-07-02 (branch `ux-p1-dewizard-notes`, PR #1 → `master`, draft/unmerged).** Built on top of the P1 de-wizard commit. All items tsc-clean, verified in headless Chrome:

- **`/simple` "Panel Maker" (new page + `src/lib/simpleLayout.ts`):** form-driven simplified generator that reuses the renderer + export. Fields: session label, headline, subtitle, one moderator + N speakers (add/remove) each with name/title/company + optional headshot upload; format 16:9/1:1/9:16, background picker, live preview, PNG/JPG export. Layout matches the hand-made house style (from Auri's exported `preset2`): everything LEFT-aligned; **session label = white pill with dark uppercase text**; headline (600, auto-fit to width) + subtitle (400); rounded-rect PORTRAIT headshot cards (photos → rounded images, empty → placeholder frame); name (600) + title + company (400) beneath each; card height capped so photo+text clear the logo on 16:9; logo bottom-left. Header links to `/` (Advanced editor); the main editor header has a **"Panel Maker"** button → `/simple`. Deliberately NOT auto-applied: the teal color overlay + the scattered-diagonal photo arrangement (both were one-design specifics).
- **Formats reframed to the 3 share targets:** `16:9 Full HD (1920×1080)`, `1:1 Square (1500×1500)`, `9:16 Story (1080×1920)`, Custom — labels + order only (dimensions already matched). Dropped "Presentation"/"Instagram Story".
- **Clean-slate presets:** removed all 5 built-in panels; `PRESETS = []`. Ship your own via "Copy code" in the Templates modal → paste into `presets.ts`.
- **Anti-squish load safeguard:** loading a template opens the canvas at the format it was DESIGNED for (unless a variant exists for the current format), so a 16:9 layout no longer gets crammed into a 1:1 canvas across devices. (Screen size never squishes — canvas scales uniformly.)
- **Color picker rebuilt (`ColorPicker.tsx`):** removed the native `<input type=color>` OS dialog (its focus-steal broke the popover, caused the Windows error ding, and swallowed later clicks). Now fully in-DOM: brand swatches + recents + H/S/L range sliders + hex. Removed the focus-out guards that were only there for the OS dialog.
- **Paste-into-text fix:** editable text now pastes PLAIN TEXT only (`onPaste` → `insertText`). Was inserting the clipboard's rich HTML/background → could black out the canvas.
- **Image-drag lag fix:** the sessionStorage persist effect is now DEBOUNCED (~350ms). It was `JSON.stringify`-ing the whole doc — including each photo's multi-MB base64 `src` — on every pointermove, which was the real drag lag (pictures only). Also memoized `CanvasBackground` + pause it during drag.
- **SVG logos:** header + canvas + drag-overlay now use vector SVGs (`public/logo-{red,white,gradient,black,outlined-white}.svg`) instead of the PNGs (crisp at any scale + in export).
- **Group drag fix:** grabbing ANY grouped member (text included) now drags the whole group. Was asymmetric because shapes/images run `selectWithGroup` on click but text enters edit mode; `beginGroupDrag` now expands the dragged element to its group.
- **Selection polish:** dashed selection outline halved (4px → 2px); removed the 4px outline offset so the highlight hugs the element; canvas text is `user-select:none` except while editing (marquee no longer highlights text like a PDF).
- **"Snap to" toggle:** magnet button in the controls strip, ON by default; off = freeform placement (no snapping, no guide lines) for images/shapes/text/logo.
- **Editor-polish batch:** Templates-modal save buttons icon-only; compositional grid cells now SQUARE at any aspect (+ rule-of-thirds); default export = JPG; default background = orb ("Soft Ember"); text shows a move cursor (I-beam only in edit mode); crop-mode scale anchors sit on the whole image, not the frame.
- **Notes:** PROGRESS.md reprioritized to first-run intuitiveness (P0).

- **Template gallery empty state (2026-07-02, same branch `ux-p1-dewizard`):** new `PresetThumbnail.tsx` renders a static (no-WebGL) mini-preview of any preset (CSS-gradient bg + positioned text/shapes/slots). Empty canvas now shows a "Start from a template" gallery of `visiblePresets` cards; click loads (`handleLoadPreset`), "Start blank" dismisses to the plain placeholder (which has a "Browse templates" reopen button). `galleryDismissed` state gates it. Note: presets have no stored thumbnails — the preview is computed live from preset data, so it stays in sync automatically. tsc clean, serves 200.
- **P3 accessibility partial (2026-07-02, same branch `ux-p1-dewizard`):** semantic landmarks (header/main/aside), contrast bump on 120 low-opacity text classes (14 files), focus-visible rings on all 13 inputs. Compiles + serves 200, introduced 0 new lint errors.
- **P2 partial (2026-07-02, same branch `ux-p1-dewizard`):** renamed "Shapes" tab → "Elements"; stripped all `▪` decorative section bullets. Compiles + serves 200.
- **Known pre-existing lint (NOT from the UX work; present on `master`):** 10 `react-hooks/*` ESLint errors — `set-state-in-effect` in StepText.tsx:31, StepElements.tsx:33, useFolderOrder/useHiddenPresets/usePresetOverrides/useTemplates/useUserPresets; `rules-of-hooks` (conditional hooks) in LogoDragOverlay.tsx:126/171; `refs`-during-render in CanvasBackground.tsx:251. App compiles + runs regardless (React Compiler strict lint, not Turbopack blockers). Worth a dedicated code-health pass.
- **P1 UX restructure (2026-07-02, branch `ux-p1-dewizard`, not yet merged to `master`):** de-wizared the left column (persistent tool tabs, removed StepNavigator Back/Next), moved export to a persistent header button + PNG/JPG toggle (removed the duplicate strip Download), docked the Layers panel as a persistent right column (default open, ResizeObserver rescales canvas on toggle). Compiles clean, ESLint 0 errors, serves 200.
- Outline-shape hit-test (click only on stroke; hollow interior is click-through to elements below).
- Locked elements still selectable (mousedown selects, drag bails; marquee includes them; orange 🔒 badge on canvas + toast on lock/unlock).
- Layers-panel click-outside-to-close.
- Right-click on unselected element now selects that element synchronously (reads `data-canvas-element` instead of waiting on stale React state).
- Z-order shortcuts (`⌘]` / `⌘[` / `⇧⌘]` / `⇧⌘[`) + context-menu items.
- Shift / Alt resize modifiers (aspect lock / from-center) on both images and shapes.
- Group / Ungroup (`⌘G` / `⇧⌘G`) + context-menu.
- Text effects: line-height, rotation, italic, opacity, blur.
- Templates: save / load / rename / delete with localStorage + PNG thumbnails.
- Brand color palette + recent colors (cross-picker synced).
- Alignment + distribute popover (canvas-aware vs selection-aware target).
- Grid overlay toggle (100×100, never exports).
- Shapes step: full editor (rectangle / circle / line / star, fill/outline, solid/gradient, stroke, opacity, blur, rotation, per-corner radius for rect, spikes + inner radius for star) + drag/resize + Layers integration.
- Multi-image upload (up to 10) + per-image border color + stroke width input.
- Element locking (lock icon in Layers panel, right-click menu).
- Multi-select via marquee + group drag.
- Inline crop (Google Slides–style, with snapshot + 4 corner handles + smart aspect normalize).
- Undo/redo cap=10 with transactions, pure-state hook.
- 18 background presets (originally 9 LM + 9 wild → trimmed to 18 LM variants).
- 2 fonts (Onest + Inter) with picker per-text-layer.

## Historical notes (so future-you doesn't accidentally restore them)

- We had 9 wild backgrounds (mesh, smoke, rays, voronoi, spiral, waves, halftone/dots, grain). User preferred only the liquid-metal aesthetic. They were removed and the registry was expanded to 18 LM variants instead.
- Background picker briefly used per-thumbnail WebGL with a sequential capture queue. Caused the main canvas's WebGL context to evict on tab switches → switched to static CSS gradients.
- Old fonts: Archivo (headlines) + Host Grotesk (subtitles). Replaced by Onest + Inter; `/public/fonts/` cleared.
- Earlier `useUndoableDoc` mutated refs INSIDE `setHistory` callbacks — broke under React 19's compiler + StrictMode (the second invocation took the wrong branch). Fixed by moving all transaction state INTO history state.
- Original right-click menu was per-image in `ImageDragOverlay`. Replaced by a unified page-level menu so all canvas elements use the same UI.
- Wizard had 5 steps once: Canvas, Text, Images, Style, Export. "Style" was merged into Canvas. "Export" became a button. Step 4 (Shapes) was added later.
- TechBBQ logo had a partner-logo concept once; removed entirely. Image upload step replaced it.
- `LogoPositionPicker.tsx` deleted — logo position is now drag-only on canvas plus preset corners via the Layers panel.
- Text used to default to UPPERCASE; changed to mixed-case default (toggle still works).
